        <div class="success-story">
            <img src="images/nina.webp"  class="profile-pic">
            <p class="quote">"Nina, a student from Russia, had always dreamed of studying in the United States, but her TOEFL score was a major hurdle. Her first attempt at the exam was challenging. Despite putting in months of preparation, she only scored a 75, far below the required 90 for her desired university.
                Instead of giving up, Nina took her initial experience as an opportunity to reflect on her weaknesses. She realized that while her reading and listening skills were solid, her speaking and writing needed improvement. To address these areas, Nina enrolled in an intensive TOEFL prep course, where she received personalized feedback on her writing and speaking.
                In her second attempt, Nina focused on perfecting her speaking fluency by practicing daily with a language exchange partner. She also used online resources like TOEFL practice tests and review videos to sharpen her writing. She dedicated one hour each day to practice speaking in front of a mirror, recording her responses, and listening to them to identify mistakes.
                The result? Nina scored a 101 on her second attempt—well above the required score for her university application. With her new score, she was accepted into the program she had dreamed of. Nina’s success story teaches the importance of perseverance, self-reflection, and using feedback to improve."</p>

        <div class="success-story">
            <img src="images/ali.jpg" class="profile-pic">
            <p class="quote">"Ali, a young man from Egypt, faced a tough challenge when he decided to take the TOEFL. He had always struggled with English, especially when it came to academic writing and speaking. His first attempt at the TOEFL was a disaster, with a score of 65, which left him feeling disheartened.
                Determined to improve, Ali set a clear goal: he would not let this setback define his future. He started by breaking down the TOEFL test into manageable parts, focusing on one section at a time. He practiced writing essays every day, reviewing sample essays, and learning from his mistakes. He also recorded his speech to analyze his pronunciation and fluency.
                Ali didn’t stop there—he joined an online study group with peers from around the world. This provided him with valuable practice opportunities for speaking and listening. They would conduct mock tests and exchange feedback, which gave Ali a sense of camaraderie and motivation.
                When Ali retook the TOEFL a few months later, his hard work paid off. He scored a 94, exceeding the score requirement for his intended university. His success was not just about the score, but also about the confidence he gained in his ability to overcome challenges. Ali's story highlights the power of persistence, self-discipline, and seeking support from others when preparing for exams like the TOEFL."</p>
